## Overview
This research focuses on the development of a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that utilizes both EEG (Electroencephalogram) and Eye Tracking for enhanced web access. The proposed approach offers an affordable and user-friendly alternative to traditional BCI systems, which are often complex and require specialized equipment.
